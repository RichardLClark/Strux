# Strux

Well-tested, fully-documented, MIT-licensed data structures written in Swift that are compatible with Swift 4 and Swift 5. Currently it has three data structures:

**Queue**: a queue with *O(1)* addition and removal.

**Heap**: a min or max heap that can be used as a priority queue.

**BSTree**: a counted, self-balancing (AVL) binary search tree that conforms to the `BidirectionalCollection` protocol, with *O(n)* in-order traversal, and *O(1)* height, count, first, last, median, and (if the type is numeric) sum.
